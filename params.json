Please check back later!**\r\n\r\nI explored the `Longstaff - Schwartz two-factor general equilibrium term structure model` in my master thesis. \r\nThis GitHub page is a collection of what I accomplished, found. I wanted to make this public in order to help fellow researchers.\r\nThe project is implemented in `R`.\r\n\r\nIn my thesis I present two calibration technique:\r\n1. Long-run calibration\r\n2.

### Implementation of the Longstaff-Schwartz term structure model
---

**This was my master thesis. The GitHub version is currently under development. Please check back later!**

I explored the `Longstaff - Schwartz two-factor general equilibrium term structure model` in my master thesis. 
This GitHub page is a collection of what I accomplished, found. I wanted to make this public in order to help fellow researchers.
The project is implemented in `R`.
